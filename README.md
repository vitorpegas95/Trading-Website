<h3>Notes</h3><br>
-Ok you need to change a few things, first your DB Settings and other settings can be found under config/config.php.<br>
-If you are gonna use Facebook, twiiter and/or Google login, you need to setup your keys (public and secret API keys) in the file app/init.php<br>
-You have to change all the URL's with localhost to your actual website.<br>
-I think that's all you need to change. Of course you can give it another name by heading to config.php and change the SITE_NAME variable.<br>
